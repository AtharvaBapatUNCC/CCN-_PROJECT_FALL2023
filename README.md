# CCN-_PROJECT_FALL2023
This is a repo we created to upload the project for NERF. That is creating an video output from a images input. where the subject in the images creates novel poses. This Repo contains the code for creating the output image and then Streamlit Code to showcase the client server application using localtunnel to create a novel pose video from images.
